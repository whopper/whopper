## Hi, my name is Will (or whopper, whopperPDX, etc!) 👋

I'm a senior software engineer at GitHub :octocat: on the Developer Confidence team. We make sure the development experience is smooth for all of the engineering teams here at Github (in-house CI backend & infra, dev tools & environments, chatops, etc).

I live in Portland, Oregon 🌲 &nbsp;and in my free time I like cycling 🚲, home improvement projects 🔨, video & board games 🎮 + 🎲, and travelling whenever I can 🗺️!
